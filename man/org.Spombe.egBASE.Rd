\description{

  Welcome to the org.Spombe.eg.db annotation Package.  This is an
  organism specific package.  The purpose is to provide detailed
  information about the species abbreviated in the second part of the
  package name org.Spombe.eg.db.  "Hs" is for Homo sapiens.  This
  package is updated biannually.
  
  You can learn what objects this package supports with the following command:

  \code{ls("package:org.Spombe.eg.db")} 
  
  Each of these objects has their own manual page detailing where relevant
  data was obtained along with examples of how to use it.  Many of these
  objects also have a reverse map available.  When this is true, expect
  to usually find relevant information on the same manual page as the
  forward map.
